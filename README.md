<h1>REWeps - A weapon set for Ultimate Doom/Doom II</h1>

<h2>What! What is this? (Introduction)</h2>
REWeps is Resident Evil-styled weapons for Doom 2. The sprites were made by rendering models in Blender down to a base canvas, then further touching up in Photoshop.

<h2>It's a weapon! It's really powerful! (Weapon Descriptions)</h2>
Currently, there are 2 weapons:
<ul>
  <li>Beretta M9 - A semi-auto 9mm pistol with an alt-fire mode for less recoil.</li>
  <li>Benelli M3S - A semi-auto shotgun</li>
</ul>
Each weapon is contained in a PK3 for easy editing. As of now, they are written for DECORATE but can be easily converted to ZScript.

<h2>Stop it! Don't open that door! (Known Issues)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Beretta has a pathetic reload animation. Should tidy this up.</li>
  <li>Beretta does a lot of damage. Should be nerfed.</li>
  <li>Benelli may need a reload speed increase.</li>
  <li>Benelli does not have a shell casing sprite for shell ejections due to me not knowing where the sprites came from. They have been removed, but the code is still there.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Credits</h2>
Credits are contained in each PK3.
